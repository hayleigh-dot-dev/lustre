# 07 Routing

We haven't quite got round to documenting this example yet. You can still check out the [source code](./src/app.gleam) and run it with the following command:

```sh
gleam run -m lustre/dev start --use-example-styles
```

## Getting help

If you're having trouble with Lustre or are not sure what the right way to do
something is, the best place to get help is the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).
You could also open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).
