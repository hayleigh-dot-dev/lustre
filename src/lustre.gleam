//// Lustre is a framework for rendering Web applications and components using
//// Gleam. This module contains the core API for constructing and communicating
//// with the different kinds of Lustre application.
//// 
//// Lustre currently has two kinds of application:
//// 
//// 1. A client-side single-page application: think Elm or React or Vue. These
////    are applications that run in the client's browser and are responsible for
////    rendering the entire page.
//// 
//// 2. A client-side component: an encapsulated Lustre application that can be
////    rendered inside another Lustre application as a Web Component. Communication
////    happens via attributes and event listeners, like any other encapsulated
////    HTML element.
//// 
//// 3. A Lustre Server Component. These are applications that run anywhere Gleam
////    runs and communicate with any number of connected clients by sending them
////    patches to apply to their DOM. 
//// 
////    On the server, these applications can be communicated with by sending them
////    messages directly. On the client communication happens the same way as
////    client-side components: through attributes and event listeners.
//// 
//// No matter where a Lustre application runs, it will always follow the same
//// Model-View-Update architecture. Popularised by Elm (where it is known as The
//// Elm Architecture), this pattern has since made its way into many other
//// languages and frameworks and has proven to be a robust and reliable way to
//// build complex user interfaces.
//// 
//// There are three main building blocks to the Model-View-Update architecture:
//// 
//// - A `Model` that represents your application's state and an `init` function
////   to create it.
//// 
//// - A `Msg` type that represents all the different ways the outside world can
////   communicate with your application and an `update` function that modifies
////   your model in response to those messages.
//// 
//// - A `view` function that renders your model to HTML, represented as an
////   `Element`.
//// 
//// To see how those pieces fit together, here's a little diagram:
//// 
//// ```text
////                                          +--------+
////                                          |        |

// TYPES -----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Represents a constructed Lustre application that is ready to be started.
/// Depending on the kind of application you've constructed you have a few 
/// options:
/// 
/// - Use [`start`](#start) to start a single-page-application in the browser.
/// 
/// - Use [`start_server_component`](#start_server_component) to start a Lustre
///   Server Component anywhere Gleam will run: Erlang, Node, Deno, or in the
///   browser.
/// 
/// - Use [`start_actor`](#start_actor) to start a Lustre Server Component only
///   for the Erlang target. BEAM users should always prefer this over
///   `start_server_component` so they can take advantage of OTP features.
/// 
/// - Use [`register`](#register) to register a component in the browser to be
///   used as a Custom Element. This is useful even if you're not using Lustre
///   to build a SPA.

/// 
/// Take a look at the [`simple`](#simple) application constructor if you want to
/// build something interactive.
